                I am a rising junior at Penn State University majoring in Computer Science and pursuing a minor in
                Digital Entrepreneurship and Innovation. I love problem-solving and have been interested
                in tech and how it works since I was a kid! 
                In high school I enrolled in CS courses to learn Python and Java programming. 
                That's where I truly found my interest in coding and computer science.
                Now, in college, I have further developed my Python and Java skills
                and have learned C programming. I've created this website to better my CSS and HTML skills
                while creating a place to connect with others and show my portfolio.
