                    called Vole! In this club, I've held the position of social chair and have helped plan
                    multiple events like formals and homecoming.</h3>

                    lucky enough to volunteer in high school and now for the past 2 years at Penn State. We raise
                    money for children and families battling childhood cancer. Last year, we were able to raise 
                    over $13 million FTK!</h3>

                    multiple stories for both the district and the community while simultaneously running the studio 
                    on a day-to-day basis. From this experience, I learned how to use filming and editing equipment.
